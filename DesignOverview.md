# High-Performance Hamilton Product CUDA Kernel for Quaternion Neural Networks

## Overview

This document outlines a highly optimized standalone CUDA kernel for the Hamilton product, tailored to quaternion-valued neural networks (QNNs) on **Nvidia GPUs**. We focus on both elementwise (vectorized) multiplication and batched matrix-style operations, covering data layouts, warp-level parallelism, shared-memory tiling, and relevant architectural nuances. The goal: **keep quaternion operations from being a bottleneck** during training and inference by fusing all arithmetic into a single efficient kernel.

## Quaternion Hamilton Product in QNNs

A quaternion $q$ can be represented as
$$q = w + x\mathbf{i} + y\mathbf{j} + z\mathbf{k}.$$
The **Hamilton product** of $q = (a, b, c, d)$ and $r = (e, f, g, h)$ is:

$$
\begin{aligned}
q * r = ( \quad
&ae \ - \ bf \ - \ cg \ - \ dh, \\
&af \ + \ be \ + \ ch \ - \ dg, \\
&ag \ - \ bh \ + \ ce \ + \ df, \\
&ah \ + \ bg \ - \ cf \ + \ de \quad ) 
\end{aligned}
$$

This involves **16 real multiplications** and **12 real additions**. Although QNNs can use 4× fewer parameters than equivalent real-valued networks, the Hamilton product is more complex than a simple float multiply–add. Efficient parallelization on GPU is thus essential to avoid performance pitfalls.

## Elementwise Kernel Design

The simplest approach assigns **one CUDA thread per quaternion multiply**. Each thread loads two quaternions from global memory, performs the 16 mul + 12 add, and writes out a single quaternion result. Here’s a stripped-down example:

```cpp
struct Quaternion { float w, x, y, z; };

__global__ void hamiltonProductKernel(
    const Quaternion* __restrict__ A,
    const Quaternion* __restrict__ B,
    Quaternion* __restrict__ C,
    int N)
{
    int idx = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    if (idx < N) {
        float a = A[idx].w, b = A[idx].x, c = A[idx].y, d = A[idx].z;
        float e = B[idx].w, f = B[idx].x, g = B[idx].y, h = B[idx].z;

        float rw = a*e - b*f - c*g - d*h;
        float rx = a*f + b*e + c*h - d*g;
        float ry = a*g - b*h + c*e + d*f;
        float rz = a*h + b*g - c*f + d*e;

        C[idx] = {rw, rx, ry, rz};
    }
}
```

**Why one thread per quaternion?** 
- Each thread fetches 8 floats (two quaternions) and writes 4 floats (result). 
- The GPU’s warp-level parallelism allows handling large batches of quaternions in parallel.
- This kernel tends to be **memory-bandwidth-bound** on modern hardware, so ensuring alignment and coalescing is vital.

### AoS vs. SoA
- **Array of Structures (AoS)**: Each quaternion is 16 bytes, and consecutive quaternions occupy contiguous 16-byte chunks. Threads in a warp read a contiguous region of memory, which is typically coalesced.
- **Structure of Arrays (SoA)**: Storing components in separate arrays can also achieve coalescing but requires more pointers. Since the Hamilton product uses all four components, AoS is often simpler and efficient.

## Batched Matrix–Vector Multiplication for QNN Layers

Many QNN layers do something like this:

$$\mathbf{y_n}=\sum_{m=1}^{M} \mathbf{W}_{n,m} \otimes \mathbf{x_m}$$


where $\mathbf{W}_{n,m}$ and $\mathbf{x}_m$ are quaternions. This is akin to a dense GEMM, except each "multiply" is a Hamilton product. If $N$ or $M$ is large, a naive one-thread-per-output approach can be slow because each thread loops over $M$. Instead, we use **tiling** in shared memory:

1. **Partition $\mathbf{x}$ into tiles** (e.g., 32 quaternions) and load each tile once into shared memory.
2. **Assign a warp** to each output quaternion $\mathbf{y}_n$. 
3. **Within that warp**, each thread multiplies one piece of the tile: $W_{n,j} \otimes \mathbf{x}_j$, and then does a warp-level reduction (summation) of all partial results.
4. Move to the next tile of $\mathbf{x}$ until we cover $M$. Accumulate in registers, then write $\mathbf{y}_n$ to global memory.

**Why tiling?** We reuse each tile of $\mathbf{x}$ across multiple outputs, saving global memory bandwidth. We rely on warp shuffles or shared-memory reductions to combine partial sums. Recent GPU architectures also offer asynchronous copy and advanced concurrency, which can further reduce latency when done carefully.

---

## Architectural Considerations

- **Memory Bandwidth**:  
  Many modern GPUs offer high memory bandwidth. For elementwise quaternion multiply (28 FLOPs per quaternion), the operation can often be limited by how fast data can be read from global memory.  

- **Parallelism & Warp Utilization**:  
  - Each SM runs many warps concurrently.  
  - Occupancy is typically high given the low register usage per thread.  
  - Tiled matrix kernels leverage shared memory for higher arithmetic intensity.

- **FP32 vs. Mixed Precision**:  
  While tensor cores accelerate matrix ops on half or BF16 data, quaternions typically do not map neatly to those specialized instructions. A straightforward FP32 CUDA kernel is usually the most direct approach.

## Implementation Sketch: Tiled Warp-Parallel Kernel

Below is **pseudo-code** for batched `W * x -> y`, using a warp to compute each output quaternion in partial tiles:

```cpp
// Suppose blockDim = 256 (8 warps); each warp computes one or more y's.
__global__ void quatMatVecMulTiled(
    const Quaternion* W,  // (N*M quaternions)
    const Quaternion* x,  // (M quaternions)
    Quaternion* y,        // (N quaternions, result)
    int N, int M)
{
    extern __shared__ Quaternion tileX[]; // for up to tileSize quaternions
    int warpId = (blockIdx.x * (blockDim.x / 32)) + (threadIdx.x / 32);
    if (warpId >= N) return;

    // Each warp will compute y[warpId], accumulating partial sums in registers:
    Quaternion acc = {0,0,0,0};
    int lane = threadIdx.x % 32;

    // Loop over input tiles
    for (int tileStart = 0; tileStart < M; tileStart += 32) {
        // Load 32 quaternions from x into shared memory
        int idx = tileStart + lane;
        if (idx < M) {
            tileX[lane] = x[idx];
        }
        __syncthreads();

        // Each warp thread handles one element of this tile (if valid)
        // Weight index = warpId*M + tileStart + lane
        if (idx < M) {
            Quaternion Wq = W[warpId*M + idx];
            Quaternion Xq = tileX[lane];
            // Hamilton product Wq * Xq
            float rw = Wq.w*Xq.w - Wq.x*Xq.x - Wq.y*Xq.y - Wq.z*Xq.z;
            float rx = Wq.w*Xq.x + Wq.x*Xq.w + Wq.y*Xq.z - Wq.z*Xq.y;
            float ry = Wq.w*Xq.y - Wq.x*Xq.z + Wq.y*Xq.w + Wq.z*Xq.x;
            float rz = Wq.w*Xq.z + Wq.x*Xq.y - Wq.y*Xq.x + Wq.z*Xq.w;

            acc.w += rw; acc.x += rx; acc.y += ry; acc.z += rz;
        }
        __syncthreads();
    }

    // Optionally do warp-level reduction if partial sums need to be combined.
    // If each lane is independent, the final result might already be in 'acc'.
    // Write out one quaternion per warp.
    if (lane == 0) {
        y[warpId] = acc;
    }
}
```

This approach:
- Loads sub-tiles of $\mathbf{x}$ into shared memory. 
- Distributes multiplication among threads in a warp, accumulating partial results in registers. 
- Reduces overhead by reusing $\mathbf{x}$ for multiple outputs if the block has multiple warps.

## Performance Insights

- **Elementwise Multiply**:  
  Often memory-bound. Proper coalescing, alignment, and large problem sizes can help approach peak memory throughput.  

- **Batched Matrix Multiply**:  
  With tiling, each input quaternion can be reused multiple times, boosting arithmetic intensity and potentially making the kernel more compute-bound. Large $N$ -by- $M$ QNN layers can see significant speedups over naive scalar implementations.

- **Implementation Complexity**:  
  A fully optimized quaternion matrix–matrix multiply follows the same tiling logic used in traditional GEMM. The challenge is that each “multiply” is the Hamilton product, not a simple float multiply–add. Nonetheless, proper tiling and parallel reduction can dramatically improve throughput.

## Integration into QNN Layers

1. **Keep Data on GPU**: Allocate `W`, `x`, and `y` in device memory to avoid unnecessary transfers.  
2. **Use AoS Layout**: Each weight quaternion is `(w, x, y, z)` in a single 16-byte struct, aligned for efficient loads.  
3. **Launch the Kernel**: 
   ```cpp
   // For an N x M quaternion matrix multiply:
   dim3 block(256);
   dim3 grid( (N + (block.x/32) - 1) / (block.x/32) );
   size_t sharedBytes = 32 * sizeof(Quaternion); // tile for x
   quatMatVecMulTiled<<<grid, block, sharedBytes>>>(d_W, d_x, d_y, N, M);
   ```
4. **Apply Activations / Next Layers**: Chain further quaternion operations as needed.  

For backprop, similar kernels handle the gradient wrt inputs or weights, often invoking Hamilton products with conjugates.

## Conclusion

A dedicated CUDA kernel for the Hamilton product significantly boosts performance in Quaternion Neural Networks. By:
- **Fusing** arithmetic into a single pass,
- Using **coalesced** memory access,
- Exploiting **tiling** and shared memory,

we transform quaternion arithmetic from a potential bottleneck into a highly parallelized routine. This lays the groundwork for efficient large-scale QNNs that can leverage the parameter savings of quaternions without sacrificing runtime.
