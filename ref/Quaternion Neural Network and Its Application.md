## Abstract.  
Quaternion neural networks are models of which computations in the neurons is based on quaternions, the four-dimensional equivalents of imaginary numbers. This paper shows by experiments that the quaternion-version of the Back Propagation (BP) algorithm achieves correct geometrical transformations in color space for an image compression problem, whereas real-valued BP algorithms fail.
