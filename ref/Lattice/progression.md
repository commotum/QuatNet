Here’s a summary of your proposed evolution of concepts that humans tend to perceive in a sequential order, based on your examples and reasoning. I’ll refine and structure your ideas while keeping the core intact, then elaborate on how these might reflect human cognition.

### Summary of the Evolution of Perceived Concepts

1. **Currency (Current, Direction, Momentum)**  
   - **What it is**: This is the earliest and most immediate concept humans detect—motion or change in space. It answers the question, "Which way is something going?" For example, when observing a bouncing ball, the first perception is its direction ("this way" or "that way").  
   - **Why it comes first**: Humans are wired to notice movement instinctively, likely due to survival instincts (e.g., detecting predators or prey). It’s a visceral, spatial awareness requiring minimal abstraction—just an intuitive grasp of "where" or "how" something shifts.  

2. **Order (Precedence, Subsequence, Coincidence, Before/After)**  
   - **What it is**: This builds on currency by introducing a temporal sequence relative to events or objects. It answers "When?" with simple relational terms like "now," "before," or "after." For instance, "Which wall will the ball hit first? Second? Third?"  
   - **Why it comes second**: Once motion is perceived, humans naturally begin to organize it into a sequence. This requires slightly more cognitive processing than raw directionality, as it involves comparing events or positions in time or space. The concept of "now" as a baseline (represented by "=" for simultaneity) emerges here as a foundation for understanding order.  

3. **Scale (Magnitude, Quantity)**  
   - **What it is**: This adds a layer of measurement or extent to the prior concepts, addressing "How much?" or "How far?" Examples include "How far will the ball bounce?" or "How far up the river are we?"  
   - **Why it comes third**: Scale demands a higher level of abstraction. It’s not just about noticing movement or sequencing events but quantifying them. This involves mental tools like comparison, estimation, or even symbolic representation (e.g., "+" for addition, "−" for negation), suggesting it develops after the foundational perceptions of direction and order.

### Interpretation and Cognitive Evolution
Your progression—Currency → Order → Scale—mirrors how human perception might evolve from immediate, sensory-driven awareness to more abstract reasoning:  
- **Currency** is primal and instinctive, tied to spatial navigation and survival. It’s the raw "what’s happening" detection.  
- **Order** introduces relativity and basic time awareness, a step toward structuring the world beyond the present moment.  
- **Scale** reflects a leap into quantification, requiring memory, comparison, and sometimes tools or symbols, hinting at the beginnings of complex thought or language.

Your symbolic mappings ("=" as simultaneity, "−" as negation, "+" as addition) align with this, suggesting that as humans process these concepts, they assign meaning to relationships and magnitudes, paving the way for mathematics and logic.
