        # biases: (N_out_q, 4)
        # cpp_layer_ptr_capsule: A PyCapsule holding the C++ layer pointer (if C++ object manages state like pre-activations)
        # OR, if W and B are passed to stateless C++ functions:
        # forward(ctx, x_input, weights, biases, M_in_q, N_out_q, activation_type_int)

        ctx.save_for_backward(x_input, weights, biases) # PyTorch manages parameters
        # If cpp_layer_ptr is used to store pre-activations, it needs careful handling or re-evaluation in backward.
        # For simplicity, let's assume the C++ layer is mostly stateless for forward/backward calls now,
        # receiving W and B. However, your current C++ class is stateful.
        # This part needs alignment between C++ class design and autograd needs.

        # Simplification: Assume the C++ layer doesn't need its own state saved via capsule for autograd
        # and that its internal pointers d_W, d_b are updated from these tensors if needed,
        // or better, the C++ functions called by bindings directly use these tensor pointers.

        # For the current QuaternionDenseLayer that has its own d_W, d_b:
        # This is a conceptual problem. PyTorch's nn.Parameter W and B are the source of truth.
        # The C++ layer needs to USE these.
        # Easiest way for now: the C++ functions exposed by bindings take tensor data pointers.
        # The C++ QuaternionDenseLayer class will not be directly instantiated in Python for autograd.
        
        # Let's assume quatnet_cuda.dense_forward_cpp(x_input, weights, biases, activation_type_enum)
        # This means the C++ QuaternionDenseLayer forward needs to be callable without an object,
        # or we modify the C++ bindings to handle this.
        
        # The existing bindings are quatnet_dense_forward_cpp(layer_ptr, x_tensor)
        # This implies the layer_ptr holds W and B. This conflicts with nn.Parameter.

        # **REVISED STRATEGY for autograd.Function with nn.Parameter:**
        # The bound C++ functions (isokawa_forward_cpp / quatnet_dense_forward_cpp)
        # should directly take W and B tensor data pointers, not a layer object.
        # The C++ `QuaternionDenseLayer` is then a utility for kernel organization,
        // but not directly bound as a stateful Python object for autograd.

        # For this example, let's assume the bound C++ function knows the activation
        # or it's passed as an int/enum. The `QuaternionDenseLayer` constructor takes it.
        # This requires modifying the C++ bindings and C++ functions.

        # Placeholder - this call needs to be aligned with how your actual C++ bindings will work
        # with W and B as parameters. For now, let's assume a hypothetical direct call.
        # This call will internally do WX+B and then activation.
        # It also needs to save pre-activations (S_internal) for backward.
        # Let's assume the C++ binding quatnet_cuda.quatnet_dense_forward_pt takes all params:
        # output_Y, pre_activations = quatnet_cuda.quatnet_dense_forward_pt(x_input, weights, biases, M_in, N_out, activation_type_enum_val)

        # We need a similar one for your original `QuaternionDenseLayer`.
        # Let's assume you create `quatnet_dense_forward_cpp_parcollet` in bindings.cpp that
        # uses launchQuatMatVecMul, launchAddBias, and the activation kernels.
        
        # For now, this cannot be fully implemented without the corresponding C++ binding
        # that takes W and B as tensors for a Parcollet-style layer.
